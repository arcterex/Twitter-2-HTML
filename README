== Twitter 2 HTML

Convert a twitter feed from XML into HTML so you can copy and paste to your blog, site, etc.

=== Usage
Edit the source code to put in the name of the user you want to grab, if it's a file or URL to get from (for testing, speed), and tweak the output format.

Run ./twitter2html.rb

=== TODO
Tooooooooooons :)
 - configurable via command line or config file
 - tests
 - command line interface?
 - make more ruby-ish
 - make more class-y
